                Hey there! My name is Prasiddha and I'm a 16-year-old student who just graduated from 10th grade. I'm not the tallest person around, standing at 167 cm, but that doesn't stop me from reaching for the stars! One of my guilty pleasures is definitely cheese pizza - I could eat it every day and never get tired of it. As for my taste in music, I absolutely love Bollywood songs - there's just something about them that always puts me in a good mood.

                As a student, I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it's through academics, extracurricular activities, or just exploring the world around me, I'm always up for a challenge. I'm excited to share my journey with you through my website, so thanks for stopping by!

                During my 10th grade, I conducted an independent research project on the effects of air pollution on human health. Through this project, I was able to hone my research skills and gain a deeper understanding of the impact of environmental factors on our well-being. This experience has inspired me to pursue further education in the field of environmental science, with the ultimate goal of contributing to solutions for pressing environmental challenges. In addition, I have also completed internships in the fields of marketing and communications, which have given me valuable insights into the professional world and have equipped me with skills such as project management, teamwork, and effective communication.
