                During my 10th grade, I conducted an independent research project on the effects of air pollution on human health. Through this project, I was able to hone my research skills and gain a deeper understanding of the impact of environmental factors on our well-being. This experience has inspired me to pursue further education in the field of environmental science, with the ultimate goal of contributing to solutions for pressing environmental challenges. In addition, I have also completed internships in the fields of marketing and communications, which have given me valuable insights into the professional world and have equipped me with skills such as project management, teamwork, and effective communication.
